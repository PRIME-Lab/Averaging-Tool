# Averaging Tool

PRIME (Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement) Lab conducts AMS (accelerator mass spectroscopy) measurements for various elements. 

Sometimes the operator would like to quickly average the ratio and error for a series of samples.

Built to run on DAQuiri (LV 2016).

An older version exists for use on Lois and was downgraded to Labview 2009 (Averaging Tool 2009/Averaging Tool.vi).
