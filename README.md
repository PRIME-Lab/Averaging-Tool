# Averaging Tool

PRIME (Purdue Rare Isotope Measurement) Lab conducts AMS (accelerator mass spectroscopy) measurements for various elements. 

Sometimes the operator would like to quickly average the ratio and error for a series of samples.

Averaging Tool.vi was written in Labview 2015 but in order to run on the DAQ computer, it has to be downgraded to Labview 2009 (Averaging Tool 2009/Averaging Tool.vi).
